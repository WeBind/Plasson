# PlassonWebApp
This test is used to verify that Plasson's test configuration is correct.

Tests will be autommatically executed by the Jenkins Server as soon as a push command is sent to GitHub.

Keep in mind that xml and xsd test files must be present since there are some manual tests executed using these
files.
